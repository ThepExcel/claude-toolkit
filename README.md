## Installation

### For Claude Code (CLI)

#### Method 1: Plugin Marketplace (Recommended)

The easiest way to install skills. Add this marketplace once, then install any skill you want:

```bash
# Step 1: Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add ThepExcel/claude-skills

# Step 2: Install the skills you want
/plugin install deep-research@thepexcel-skills
/plugin install triz@thepexcel-skills
/plugin install problem-solving@thepexcel-skills
```

**List all available skills:**
```bash
/plugin list thepexcel-skills
```

#### Method 2: Install Single Plugin from GitHub

Install a specific skill directly without adding the marketplace:

```bash
/plugin add ThepExcel/claude-skills/deep-research
```

#### Method 3: Manual Clone + Symlink

For full control or offline access:

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/ThepExcel/claude-skills.git
cd claude-skills

# Create symlinks to make skills globally available
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
for skill in */; do
    [[ -d "$skill" && ! "$skill" == .* ]] && ln -s "$(pwd)/$skill" ~/.claude/skills/$(basename "$skill")
done
```

After installation, Claude Code will automatically use these skills when relevant.

### For Claude.ai (Web)

1. Download the skill folder you want (e.g., `deep-research/`)
2. **ZIP the entire folder** (not just the files inside!)
   ```bash
   # Correct way - ZIP the folder
   zip -r deep-research.zip deep-research/
   ```
3. Go to **Settings > Capabilities** in Claude.ai
4. Scroll down to **Skills** section and click **Upload skill**

> **Important:** ZIP must contain the folder structure. If you ZIP only the files, Claude won't find SKILL.md!
>
> **Requirements:** Pro, Max, Team, or Enterprise plan.

## Skill Structure

Each skill is just a folder with at least one file: `SKILL.md`

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md          # Main file (required)
├── scripts/          # Executable code (optional)
├── references/       # Reference docs (optional)
└── assets/           # Templates, images (optional)

### 3-Level Progressive Loading

Skills use smart loading - Claude only loads what's needed:

| Level | When Loaded | Token Cost | Content |
|-------|-------------|------------|---------|
| **1. Metadata** | Session start | ~100 tokens | `name` + `description` from YAML |
| **2. Instructions** | Skill triggered | <5,000 tokens | SKILL.md body |
| **3. Resources** | When needed | Unlimited | Files in `references/`, `scripts/` |

This means you can have dozens of skills installed without performance impact!
