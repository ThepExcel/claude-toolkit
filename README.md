## Installation

### For Claude Code (CLI)

#### Method 1: Plugin Marketplace (Recommended)

The easiest way to install skills. Add this marketplace once, then install any skill you want:

```bash
# Step 1: Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add ThepExcel/claude-skills

# Step 2: Install the skills you want
/plugin install deep-research@thepexcel-skills -s project
/plugin install triz@thepexcel-skills -s project
/plugin install xlsx@thepexcel-skills -s project
```

**Installation scopes:**

| Scope | Flag | Where | Use case |
|-------|------|-------|----------|
| `project` | `-s project` | Current project only | Recommended for most cases |
| `user` | `-s user` (default) | All projects | Personal productivity skills |

> **Note:** Plugin files are cached in `~/.claude/plugins/cache/`, not copied into your project. They work seamlessly but won't appear in your project folder.

**Other useful commands:**
```bash
/plugin list thepexcel-skills              # List all available skills
/plugin marketplace update thepexcel-skills # Update to latest version
/plugin uninstall deep-research@thepexcel-skills
```

#### Method 2: Install Single Plugin from GitHub

Install a specific skill directly without adding the marketplace:

```bash
/plugin add ThepExcel/claude-skills/plugins/deep-research -s project
```

#### Method 3: Manual Clone + Symlink

For full control, offline access, or if you want files in your project:

```bash
# Clone this repo
git clone https://github.com/ThepExcel/claude-skills.git
cd claude-skills

# Create symlinks to make skills globally available
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
for skill in plugins/*/skills/*/; do
    skill_name=$(basename "$skill")
    ln -sf "$(pwd)/$skill" ~/.claude/skills/$skill_name
done
```

After installation, Claude Code will automatically use these skills when relevant.

### For Claude.ai (Web)

**Step 1: Download the skill folder**

Choose one of these methods:

| Method | How |
|--------|-----|
| **Download entire repo** | Click green **Code** button → **Download ZIP** → Extract → Find the skill folder in `plugins/*/skills/` |
| **Use download tool** | Go to [download-directory.github.io](https://download-directory.github.io/) → Paste folder URL (e.g., `https://github.com/ThepExcel/claude-skills/tree/main/plugins/deep-research/skills/deep-research`) |
| **Git clone** | `git clone https://github.com/ThepExcel/claude-skills.git` → Copy the folder from `plugins/*/skills/` |

**Step 2: ZIP the folder**

```bash
# ZIP the skill folder (must contain SKILL.md)
cd plugins/deep-research/skills
zip -r deep-research.zip deep-research/
```

**Step 3: Upload to Claude.ai**

1. Go to **Settings > Capabilities**
2. Scroll down to **Skills** section

| Level | When Loaded | Token Cost | Content |
|-------|-------------|------------|---------|
| **1. Metadata** | Session start | ~100 tokens | `name` + `description` from YAML |
| **2. Instructions** | Skill triggered | <5,000 tokens | SKILL.md body |
| **3. Resources** | When needed | Unlimited | Files in `references/`, `scripts/` |

This means you can have dozens of skills installed without performance impact!
