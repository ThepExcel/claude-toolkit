# Competitive Analysis Frameworks

## Gap Analysis

**Use when:** Identifying what needs to change to reach goals, performance improvement

### Structure

```
Current State ───── GAP ─────► Desired State
(Where we are)     (What's     (Where we want
                  missing)      to be)
```

### Steps

1. **Define desired state** - What does success look like?
2. **Assess current state** - Where are you now? (data-driven)
3. **Identify gaps** - What's the difference?
4. **Analyze root causes** - Why do gaps exist?
5. **Plan actions** - How to close each gap?

### Template

| Area | Current State | Desired State | Gap | Actions |
|------|---------------|---------------|-----|---------|
| Revenue | $1M | $2M | $1M | New products, market expansion |
| NPS | 45 | 70 | 25 points | Improve support, product quality |
| Skills | Basic data analysis | Advanced AI/ML | AI capabilities | Training program |

### Types of Gap Analysis

| Type | Focus |
|------|-------|
| **Performance Gap** | Actual vs expected performance |
| **Market Gap** | Current offerings vs market needs |
| **Skills Gap** | Current vs required competencies |
| **Compliance Gap** | Current state vs regulatory requirements |

## 3C Analysis

**Use when:** Strategic positioning, understanding competitive dynamics

### The Three Cs

```
        ┌─────────────────┐
        │    Customer     │
        │   (Needs/Wants) │
        └────────┬────────┘
                 │
    ┌────────────┼────────────┐
    │            │            │
    ▼            ▼            ▼
┌───────┐   ┌────────┐   ┌───────────┐
│Company│◄──│ VALUE  │──►│Competitors│
│(You)  │   │CREATION│   │           │
└───────┘   └────────┘   └───────────┘
```

### Analysis Questions

| C | Key Questions |
|---|---------------|
| **Customer** | Who are they? What do they need? How do they decide? What do they value? |
| **Company** | What are our strengths? Resources? Capabilities? Unique advantages? |
| **Competitor** | Who competes for same customers? Their strengths/weaknesses? Strategies? |

### Strategic Implications

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| Customer needs unmet by competitors | Opportunity to differentiate |
| Competitor weakness matches our strength | Attack strategy |
| Customer needs we can't serve | Partnership or capability building |

## Strategic Group Mapping

**Use when:** Understanding competitive positions, identifying strategic opportunities

### Steps

1. **Identify key dimensions** - What differentiates competitors? (price, quality, scope, geography)
2. **Select two dimensions** - Most strategically relevant
3. **Plot competitors** - Position on 2x2 or scatter plot
4. **Identify groups** - Cluster similar competitors
5. **Analyze** - White spaces, mobility barriers, group dynamics

### Example: Online Learning Market

```
High   │              [Enterprise
Price  │               Players]
       │                  ○
       │    [Premium     Competitor A
       │     Niche]
       │       ○ You     ○ Competitor B
       │
       │  [Budget]
       │     ○ ○ ○
Low    └────────────────────────────────
             Narrow              Broad
                   Course Range
```

### Strategic Insights

- **White space** = Potential opportunity
- **Crowded group** = Intense competition
- **Isolated position** = Unique but verify demand
- **Mobility barriers** = Difficulty moving between groups

## Competitive Profiling

**Use when:** Deep-dive on specific competitors

### Profile Template

```markdown
## Competitor: [Name]

### Overview
- **Founded:** [Year]
- **Size:** [Employees, Revenue]
- **Markets:** [Geographies, Segments]
- **Positioning:** [How they describe themselves]

### Products/Services
| Product | Target | Price Point | Differentiator |
|---------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| [Name]  | [Who]  | [$]         | [Why unique]   |

### Strengths
- [Strength 1]
- [Strength 2]

### Weaknesses
- [Weakness 1]
- [Weakness 2]

### Strategy
- [Current strategic direction]
- [Recent moves/announcements]

### Implications for Us
- [What this means for our strategy]
```

## Competitive Response Framework

**Use when:** Deciding how to respond to competitor actions

### Response Options

| Response | When to Use |
|----------|-------------|
| **Ignore** | Minor move, doesn't affect us |
| **Accommodate** | Mutual benefit possible, not core to us |
| **Defend** | Attack on our core business, must protect |
| **Attack** | Opportunity to gain advantage, have resources |

### Decision Factors

1. **Threat level** - How much does this affect us?
2. **Resources** - Can we afford to respond?
3. **Timing** - Is immediate response needed?
4. **Precedent** - What message does our response send?
