## McKinsey 7S Framework

**Use when:** Organizational alignment, change management, merger integration

### The Seven Elements

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │ Shared Values   │
                    │   (Culture)     │
                    └────────┬────────┘
                             │
         ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐
         │                   │                   │
    ┌────┴────┐         ┌────┴────┐         ┌────┴────┐
    │Structure│         │Strategy │         │ Systems │
    └────┬────┘         └────┬────┘         └────┬────┘
         │                   │                   │
         └───────────────────┼───────────────────┘
                             │
         ┌───────────────────┼───────────────────┐
         │                   │                   │
    ┌────┴────┐         ┌────┴────┐         ┌────┴────┐
    │ Skills  │         │  Staff  │         │  Style  │
    └─────────┘         └─────────┘         └─────────┘
```

### Hard vs Soft Elements

| Hard (Easier to change) | Soft (Harder to change) |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Strategy** - Plan to achieve goals | **Shared Values** - Core beliefs, culture |
| **Structure** - Organization design | **Skills** - Capabilities and competencies |
| **Systems** - Processes and procedures | **Staff** - People and talent |
| | **Style** - Leadership and management style |

### Analysis Questions

| Element | Key Questions |
|---------|---------------|
| **Strategy** | What's our plan? Is it clear? Aligned with values? |
| **Structure** | How are we organized? Who reports to whom? |
| **Systems** | What processes do we use? IT systems? Metrics? |
| **Shared Values** | What do we believe? What's our culture? |
| **Skills** | What are we good at? What do we need? |
| **Staff** | Do we have the right people? In right roles? |
| **Style** | How do leaders behave? Decision-making style? |

### Using 7S for Change

1. **Assess current state** - Score each element (1-5)
2. **Define future state** - What should each element look like?
3. **Identify gaps** - Where is misalignment?
4. **Prioritize changes** - Start with Shared Values, then Hard, then Soft
5. **Plan actions** - Specific initiatives for each gap

## Change Management Frameworks

### Lewin's 3-Stage Model

**Use when:** Simple, focused changes; quick timeline needed

```
UNFREEZE  ─────►  CHANGE  ─────►  REFREEZE
(Prepare)        (Transition)     (Solidify)
```

| Stage | Activities |
|-------|------------|
| **Unfreeze** | Create urgency, communicate why, reduce resistance |
| **Change** | Implement new processes, support people, communicate |
| **Refreeze** | Reinforce new behaviors, celebrate wins, embed in culture |

---

### Kotter's 8-Step Model

**Use when:** Complex, organization-wide changes; long-term transformation

```
1. Create Urgency          ┐
2. Form Coalition          ├─ CREATE CLIMATE
3. Create Vision           ┘

4. Communicate Vision      ┐
5. Remove Obstacles        ├─ ENGAGE & ENABLE
6. Create Quick Wins       ┘

7. Build on Change         ┐
8. Anchor in Culture       ├─ IMPLEMENT & SUSTAIN
                           ┘
```

| Step | Key Actions |
|------|-------------|
| **1. Create Urgency** | Help others see the need for change |
| **2. Form Coalition** | Assemble a group with power to lead |
| **3. Create Vision** | Develop clear vision and strategy |
| **4. Communicate Vision** | Ensure as many as possible understand |
| **5. Remove Obstacles** | Eliminate barriers, change systems |
| **6. Create Quick Wins** | Generate short-term visible improvements |
| **7. Build on Change** | Use credibility to change more |
| **8. Anchor in Culture** | Embed changes in organizational culture |

---

### ADKAR Model

**Use when:** Individual-focused change; training and adoption

```
A ─► D ─► K ─► A ─► R
│    │    │    │    │
│    │    │    │    └─ Reinforcement (sustain)
│    │    │    └─ Ability (can do it)
│    │    └─ Knowledge (how to do it)
│    └─ Desire (want to do it)
└─ Awareness (understand why)
```

| Element | Question | If Missing |
|---------|----------|------------|
| **Awareness** | Do they understand why change is needed? | Communicate urgency |
| **Desire** | Do they want to participate? | Address resistance, show WIIFM |
| **Knowledge** | Do they know how to change? | Training, education |
| **Ability** | Can they implement the change? | Practice, coaching, support |
| **Reinforcement** | Will the change stick? | Recognition, measurement, culture |

## When to Use Which Change Model

| Situation | Recommended Model |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Quick, simple change | Lewin |
| Organization-wide transformation | Kotter |
| People/behavior focused change | ADKAR |
| Technology implementation | ADKAR + Kotter |
| Cultural transformation | Kotter (emphasize step 8) |
| Merger/Acquisition | McKinsey 7S + Kotter |

---

## Resistance Management

Common resistance sources and responses:

| Resistance Type | Response |
|-----------------|----------|
| **Fear of unknown** | Communicate clearly, involve early |
| **Loss of control** | Give ownership, involve in design |
| **Bad timing** | Acknowledge, adjust if possible |
| **Lack of trust** | Build relationships, be transparent |
| **Different vision** | Listen, find common ground |
| **Habit/Comfort** | Training, support, celebrate early wins |
