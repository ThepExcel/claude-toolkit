## Ansoff Matrix

**Use when:** Planning growth direction, market/product expansion decisions

### The Four Strategies

```
                    Existing Products    New Products
                   ┌───────────────────┬───────────────────┐
Existing Markets   │ Market Penetration│ Product Development│
                   │     (Low Risk)    │   (Medium Risk)   │
                   ├───────────────────┼───────────────────┤
New Markets        │ Market Development│  Diversification  │
                   │   (Medium Risk)   │    (High Risk)    │
                   └───────────────────┴───────────────────┘
```

| Strategy | Description | Risk | Example |
|----------|-------------|------|---------|
| **Market Penetration** | Sell more of existing products to existing customers | Low | Loyalty programs, pricing, promotions |
| **Product Development** | New products for existing customers | Medium | New course topics, add-ons |
| **Market Development** | Existing products to new markets | Medium | New geography, new segments |
| **Diversification** | New products for new markets | High | Completely new business line |

### When to Use Each

- **Market Penetration:** Market is growing, low market share, competitive pricing possible
- **Product Development:** Strong customer relationships, R&D capabilities, market demand for innovation
- **Market Development:** Product has proven success, untapped markets exist, distribution capability
- **Diversification:** Core business is declining, significant resources available, risk tolerance high

## BCG Matrix (Growth-Share Matrix)

**Use when:** Portfolio analysis, resource allocation across products/business units

### The Four Quadrants

```
                    High Market Share    Low Market Share
                   ┌───────────────────┬───────────────────┐
High Market Growth │      ★ Stars      │   ? Question Marks│
                   │   (Invest heavily)│  (Evaluate & decide)│
                   ├───────────────────┼───────────────────┤
Low Market Growth  │   $ Cash Cows     │    🐕 Dogs        │
                   │  (Harvest profits)│   (Divest/Exit)   │
                   └───────────────────┴───────────────────┘
```

| Quadrant | Characteristics | Strategy |
|----------|-----------------|----------|
| **Stars** | High growth, high share | Invest to maintain leadership |
| **Cash Cows** | Low growth, high share | Harvest profits, fund other units |
| **Question Marks** | High growth, low share | Invest selectively or divest |
| **Dogs** | Low growth, low share | Minimize investment or divest |

### Analysis Steps

1. **List products/units** - All products or business units
2. **Calculate market share** - Your share vs largest competitor
3. **Assess market growth** - Industry growth rate (>10% = high)
4. **Plot on matrix** - Position each product
5. **Determine strategy** - Based on quadrant position

## Blue Ocean Strategy

**Use when:** Creating new market space, escaping competition, innovation strategy

### Red Ocean vs Blue Ocean

| Red Ocean | Blue Ocean |
|-----------|------------|
| Compete in existing market | Create uncontested market space |
| Beat the competition | Make competition irrelevant |
| Exploit existing demand | Create and capture new demand |
| Value-cost trade-off | Break value-cost trade-off |

### Four Actions Framework (ERRC)

| Action | Question |
|--------|----------|
| **Eliminate** | Which factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated? |
| **Reduce** | Which factors should be reduced well below industry standard? |
| **Raise** | Which factors should be raised well above industry standard? |
| **Create** | Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered? |

### Strategy Canvas

Plot your offering vs competitors on key factors:

```
High │    ★ Your offering
     │   ─── Competitor A
     │   ─── Competitor B
     │
Low  └───────────────────────────
         Factor1  Factor2  Factor3
```

### Example: Cirque du Soleil

| Eliminate | Reduce | Raise | Create |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------|
| Animal shows | Star performers | Unique venue | Artistic music/dance |
| Aisle concessions | Fun/humor | - | Theme/storyline |
| Multiple shows | Thrill/danger | - | Refined environment |

## McKinsey Three Horizons

**Use when:** Balancing current business with future growth, innovation planning

### The Three Horizons

```
Value │                        H3
      │                    ┌──────
      │               H2   │
      │          ┌────────┘
      │    H1    │
      │ ─────────┘
      └─────────────────────────────► Time
        Now        2-3 years   5+ years
```

| Horizon | Focus | Time | Resource Allocation |
|---------|-------|------|---------------------|
| **H1: Core** | Extend current business | Now | ~70% of effort |
| **H2: Emerging** | Build new businesses | 2-3 years | ~20% of effort |
| **H3: Future** | Create viable options | 5+ years | ~10% of effort |

### Managing Across Horizons

| Horizon | Key Activities |
|---------|----------------|
| **H1** | Optimize operations, defend market share, maximize profitability |
| **H2** | Scale emerging opportunities, build capabilities, accelerate growth |
| **H3** | Research, experiment, pilot programs, strategic partnerships |

### Modern Consideration

With accelerating change, horizons compress. What was "5+ years" might now be "2-3 years." Monitor disruption signals and adjust accordingly.
